TeleSign Web Services: C++ SDK
------------------------------

**TeleSign web services** conform to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">REST Web Service Design Model</a>. Services are exposed as URI-addressable resources through the set of *RESTful* procedures in our **TeleSign REST API**.

The **TeleSign C++ SDK** provides sample code for doing authentication with TeleSign's REST API. If you want more information about the authentication process, you can read about it on the following pages: <a href="https://developer.telesign.com/v2.0/docs/authentication-1">Authentication</a> and <a href="https://developer.telesign.com/docs/getting-started-with-the-rest-api">Getting Started with the REST API </a>.
